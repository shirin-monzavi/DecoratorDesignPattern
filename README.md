# 🎯 Decorator Pattern with C#

This project demonstrates the Decorator Pattern applied in C#. The pattern allows you to add functionality to an object dynamically, without changing its structure.
In this example, we have a base VisualComponent class, and we use decorators like BorderDecorator and ScrollDecorator to add extra behaviors (drawing borders, adding scrollbars) to a base component (TextView).
